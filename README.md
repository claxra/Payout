## The problem Payout solves

Payout solves the problem of inefficient and opaque pension fund management. It addresses three main issues in the current pension system:

- Poor investment returns: Payout aims to improve the investment returns of pension funds by implementing a decentralized governance model. Through a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), employees are given the power to vote for specific investments, increasing transparency and ensuring that the funds are allocated to potentially higher-yielding opportunities.

- Complex rules and regulations: The current pension system often suffers from complex rules and regulations that can be difficult for employees to navigate. Payout simplifies this process by automating the pension transfer at regular intervals through smart contracts. This automation reduces complexity and streamlines the fund transfer process, making it easier for employees to manage their retirement savings.

- Lack of transparency: Employees often have limited visibility into where their pension funds are being invested, leading to a lack of trust and understanding. Payout increases transparency by allowing employees to directly participate in the decision-making process through voting. This empowers them to have a say in how their retirement savings are invested and creates a more transparent and accountable system.


## Web3 as a solution to this problem -

Web3 technology, specifically blockchain and smart contracts, can potentially improve the pension system in several ways -

- Increased security and transparency - A DAO will govern a decentralized pension system, offering transparency and security for tracking and managing pension funds.
- Reduced cost and enhanced efficiency - Smart contracts can help lower the expenses of administering pension funds and improve efficiency by automating a lot of processes.
- Improved accuracy - Smart contracts can automatically execute and enforce rules and conditions, ensuring that pension payments are accurate and timely.
